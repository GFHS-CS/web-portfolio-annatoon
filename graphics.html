            <h2> Evaluating Web Graphics </h2>
            <p> I evoluated different college's 
            websites and found that the most attractive ones showed graphics of the campus and student life.
            The  more attractive websites were nicely spaced out and it was easy to find information. They used one big graphic at first to catch the attention of readers and then limited the use afterwards. The colors were very pretty; even a school with less appealing colors could make a website very attractive. The colors were bold and every part was esily distinguished from one another. The were minimal animations, but the ones used were to enhance the page. There were also not to many drop down menues, and you could move your mouse without having lots of menus popping up.
